My first simple application using Jsoup and Java to scrap the news articles off Purdue CS department's webpage.
 
Update 1: Saves the results into an XML file
Update 2: Saves the results into a JSON file

Future steps:
1.  I'll be braver and try to set up a Maven project for this instead, as well as adding the news articles into a database
2.  After that I'll probably try to create a scheduler to run the scraper every day.
